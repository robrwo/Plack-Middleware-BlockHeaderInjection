NAME
    Plack::Middleware::BlockHeaderInjection - block header injections in
    responses

SYNOPSIS
      use Plack::Builder;

      my $app = ...

      $app = builder {
        enable 'BlockHeaderInjection',
          status => 500;
        $app;
      };

DESCRIPTION
    This middleware will check responses for injected headers. If the
    headers contain newlines, then the return code is set to `500' and the
    offending header(s) are removed.

OPTIONS
  `status'
    The status code to return if an invalid header is found. By default,
    this is `500'.
