# NAME

Plack::Middleware::BlockHeaderInjection - block header injections in responses

# VERSION

version v1.1.0

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use Plack::Builder;

my $app = ...

$app = builder {
  enable 'BlockHeaderInjection',
    status => 500;
  $app;
};
```

# DESCRIPTION

This middleware will check responses for injected headers. If the
headers contain newlines, then the return code is set to `500` and
the offending header(s) are removed.

A common source of header injections is when parameters are passed
unchecked into a header (such as the redirection location).

An attacker can use injected headers to bypass system security, by
forging a header used for security (such as a referrer or cookie).

# ATTRIBUTES

## &lt;status

The status code to return if an invalid header is found. By default,
this is `500`.
